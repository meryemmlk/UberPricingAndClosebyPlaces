# Analysis of the UBER Arrival Times

In this example, the analysis of the average time it takes for a UBER car to arrive to especific point (latitude, longitude) within a neighborhood is made. The study has been carried out in the city of Natal, this metropolis belongs to the state of Rio Grande do Norte in Brazil.

Data was obtained during eight days, for 3 points within each neighborhood (36 in total) of Natal. The data capture period was 4 mim because the UBER API only allows 2000 queries per hour.
